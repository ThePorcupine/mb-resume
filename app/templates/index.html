            <div class="subtitle has-text-info is-italic is-family-secondary">“[being a Principal Engineer] is far more
                strategic, it’s far
                more business oriented, it’s involving a lot more influence, being an influencer without having the
                management title.”
                <br>
                <br>
                “[during the time becoming a Principal Engineer you] need to be a force multiplier. There was a clear
                transition from me writing code to teaching others how to write code that’s actually clean and doesn’t
                cause us trouble too fast down the line. One of the big parts of Principal Engineering in my mind is you
                teach more than you actually do yourself.”

            Primarily, my work has been on CICD and DevOps solutions, but I often get this itch to create something new.
            <span class="span is-family-monospace has-text-weight-bold">Python</span> is my go-to scripting language but
            I’m not afraid of a little <span class="span is-family-monospace has-text-weight-bold">Bash</span> or <span
                class="span is-family-monospace has-text-weight-bold">Ruby</span> if the use-case calls for it or I am
            trying to work with a library that requires the aforementioned (i.e <span
                class="span is-family-monospace has-text-weight-bold">Chef</span>). The instant gratification of making
            websites and working with complex relational database setups is a puzzle that I relish. Using <span
                class="span is-family-monospace has-text-weight-bold">Flask</span> and <span
                class="span is-family-monospace has-text-weight-bold">SQLAlchemy</span> I have put together some complex
            websites as a consultant on the side. See the <a href='#'> NexNest project </a> as an example.
